# Java-Variant

A data structure in kind of a C++ std::variant or a Type Script union

## Why?

The intention behind this class was to create a data structure for handling code situations where you can't use an interface 
because you don't have code access to at least one of the given types.
For example, this could be a standard or third-party library type.
